# MOBLIMA - SC2002 Project
MOBLIMA is a console-based application, which provides a centralized platform to cater to both
movie-goers and cinema staff. It computerizes the processes of accessing available movies and
showtimes, purchase of movie tickets, and viewing booking history for movie-goers. The cinema
staff can access and update movies, showtimes, and system settings. In this project, design considerations, principles, and use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts are demonstrated.
